# Refactoring Run Log

Backward-looking journal of what the refactoring system has *done*, run by
run (newest first). Companion to `docs/FOLLOW_UPS.md` (what's still
*outstanding*) and governed by `docs/REFACTORING_SYSTEM.md` §8.

**In a pickle:** find the suspect change below, then tell a session
*"revert the change from log entry &lt;date&gt;"*. Every change is an isolated
commit that never auto-merged, so it reverts cleanly.

Entry template (the agent appends one per run):

```

## 2026-06-22 — scheduled (scan-only)
- Outcome: Scan-only — the app is healthy and nothing was cleanly fixable this
  run. Every item near the top of the queue is already being handled in an open
  pull request, or is waiting on a decision/setup only the owner can give. No
  app code changed.
- Health checks on `main` (e49b075): typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit 184/184 ✅.
- Marker-debt grep over `src/`: no new untracked debt — the FirstBreath audio
  TODOs are tracked (FU-41), the exit-destination TODO is FU-25, and every
  `eslint-disable` is documented/tracked (FU-32 for `useResource`, plus the
  conventional Next `<img>` / exhaustive-deps sites).
- Why no fix: walked the priority queue top-down. The first items
  (FU-5/1/2/4) are already fixed on `main` and struck in open PR #62; the next
  clean code fixes (FU-43 voice-ready persist check, FU-46 init-upload
  storage_path check, FU-45 signed-URL telemetry) are all fixed in open PR #61
  (Step 7 Memory Shelf + reliability). Re-fixing any of them would duplicate an
  open PR — a banned move. The remainder are blocked: FU-22 (PR #65, + payment
  decision), FU-54 (PR #58), FU-23/44 (Stripe-hardening branch), FU-25/34/24/16/
  12/28 (owner decisions), FU-26 (needs a Supabase access-token CI secret — owner
  setup), FU-59/60 (delete a locked URL path — owner sign-off, never-touch), and
  FU-40/57/35/41/8/6-server-half/56 (visual/asset work, not browser-verifiable in
  this environment).
- Scores: no priority change is warranted that isn't already captured in an open
  PR (#62 strikes FU-1/2/4/5; #61 resolves FU-42/43/45/46; #63 logs FU-59/60).
  `FOLLOW_UPS.md` deliberately left untouched here to avoid colliding with those
  in-flight backlog edits (§5 backlog-coordination).
- Verified-resolved-in-code (recommend striking when #62/#61 merge, to avoid a
  third divergent edit of the same file now): FU-7 (Screen10 sr-only
  `role="status"` announcement present) and FU-9 (Screen10 renders
  `displayUrl = preview ?? avatarUrl` for re-entry). Flagged by triage 2026-06-13
  for the fixer to verify+strike.
- PR hygiene note (§7): there are already 3 open system docs PRs (#54, #62, #63)
  plus several fix PRs (#61, #58, #65, #59) awaiting the owner's review. The queue
  is at the max-3 ceiling for docs PRs — draining it (merging the green ones)
  unblocks the next fix run more than any new branch would.
- Branch / commit: refactor/scan-2026-06-22 @ <this commit>
- Discovered: none (the 2026-06-16 and 2026-06-19 triage passes + the 06-19
  bug-hunt already captured the open findings).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-16 — scheduled (fix)
- Outcome: Fixed — onboarding's final "save my details" step used to navigate the
  user into the app even when the save silently failed, losing everything they
  typed; it now stops and lets them retry.
- Item: FU-42 [P2] — Onboarding completion swallows a failed save → profile silently lost.
- Root cause: symptom — a new user finishes onboarding, the profile write fails
  (RLS / transient DB / constraint), and they're sent into the app anyway with
  their name/DOB/city gone and `onboarding_completed_at` still null (treated as
  not-onboarded next visit). Cause — the `completeOnboarding` server action ran
  the `profiles` UPDATE but never inspected the returned `{ error }`, so a failed
  write resolved as success; the expired-session branch (`if (!user) return;`)
  likewise resolved silently. Why this addresses the cause — the write now goes
  through `persistOnboardingCompletion`, which throws on a returned error, and
  the expired-session branch throws too. A thrown action rejects the client
  `await`, so `router.push` is skipped and the existing `OnboardingScreen`
  `try/catch` keeps the user on the final screen with their draft intact. This
  fixes the swallow at its source (the unchecked error), not a downstream symptom.
- Branch / commit: refactor/fu-42-onboarding-save-check @ 1971c6c
- Checks: typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit ✅ (184/184; +3 new in
  tests/unit/complete-onboarding.test.ts). Non-visual change (server action +
  helper); no browser verification needed.
- Discovered: FU-57 [P4] — onboarding completion failure now resets the wizard
  silently (no visible "couldn't save, try again" message). Logged, not fixed
  (UI copy → needs in-browser verification, out of scope for this run).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-13 — discovery (scheduled triage)
- Outcome: Scan-only (read-only) — logged 5 new backlog items; no code touched.
- Scanned: health checks on `main` (typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit 154/154 ✅);
  marker-debt grep over `src/` (all pre-existing TODOs already tracked); deep
  reads of the Stripe/subscription, voice-creation/ElevenLabs, audio-upload
  pipeline, onboarding, and auth/profile subsystems. Active feature branch
  `feat/step6-a6-screen` (the whole Step 6 message-creation flow) was treated
  as work-in-progress and excluded.
- Discovered (new FOLLOW_UPS entries):
  - FU-42 [P2] Onboarding completion swallows a failed save → profile silently lost.
  - FU-43 [P3] Voice-creation success doesn't verify its DB write → "ready" reported while stuck "processing".
  - FU-44 [P3] Checkout customer-id save unchecked → duplicate Stripe customers on retry.
  - FU-45 [P4] Signed-URL routes log usage "success" before the work that can fail.
  - FU-46 [P3] init-upload storage_path write unchecked → breaks commit; + dead extension ternary.
- Triggers came true: Screen 10 went live with real avatar upload — FU-6
  (object-fit half shipped), FU-7 and FU-9 appear implemented (flagged for the
  fixer to verify + strike; discovery does not strike).
- Reviewed-and-cleared: Stripe webhook handlers + `upsertSubscription` are
  correctly error-guarded and idempotent — no entry warranted.
- Branch / commit: `triage/2026-06-13` @ <this commit>
- Checks: n/a (docs-only; CI re-runs lint/typecheck/test/build on the PR).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-13 — system setup (on-demand, by Claude + owner)
- Outcome: System hardened — not an agent fix run. Recorded for traceability.
- Added: band-aid safeguards + root-cause discipline, the in-flight-branch
  skip rule, honest-verification + backlog-coordination rails, this run
  log, and a `test:unit` step in CI so the agent's "checks pass" claim is
  independently verified by GitHub.
- Branch / commit: `harden/refactoring-system` (this branch)
- Checks: n/a (docs + CI config only)
- Note: first scheduled fix run is Monday 2026-06-15 06:00 ET; a one-off
  test run was also triggered on 2026-06-13. Their entries will appear
  above this line.
