# Refactoring Run Log

Backward-looking journal of what the refactoring system has *done*, run by
run (newest first). Companion to `docs/FOLLOW_UPS.md` (what's still
*outstanding*) and governed by `docs/REFACTORING_SYSTEM.md` §8.

**In a pickle:** find the suspect change below, then tell a session
*"revert the change from log entry &lt;date&gt;"*. Every change is an isolated
commit that never auto-merged, so it reverts cleanly.

Entry template (the agent appends one per run):

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <scheduled | on-demand | discovery>
- Outcome: <Fixed | Worked around | Scan-only | Run failed> — <one plain sentence>
- Item: FU-<n> — <title>
- Root cause: <symptom → cause → why this change addresses the cause>
- Branch / commit: <refactor/fu-n-slug> @ <short SHA>
- Checks: typecheck <✅/❌> · lint <✅/❌> · test:unit <✅/❌>
- Discovered: <new FU entries, or "none">
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges, with date>

## 2026-06-19 — discovery (scheduled triage)
- Outcome: Scan-only (read-only) — logged 2 new backlog items; no code touched.
- Scanned: health checks on `main` (typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit 184/184 ✅);
  marker-debt grep over `src/` (all TODOs/disables already tracked or deliberate —
  the `guards.ts` `assertPlanAllows` stub is a documented MVP hook, not debt); deep
  reads of the cost-control / rate-limit layer (sound — fail-open is documented and
  deliberate), the vault pricing struct, and the full `src/app/api/` route map for
  orphaned endpoints.
- Excluded as work-in-progress: a heavy in-flight week — 7 open PRs (#61 Step 7
  Memory Shelf + the FU-42/43/45/46 unchecked-write batch; #58 durable ceremony
  flag → FU-54; Stripe-hardening → FU-23/44; #59 analytics funnel; #62; prior
  triage #54). All files those branches touch were treated as WIP. The prior triage
  PR #54 already logged the Step 6 generate-pipeline unchecked-write finding and the
  stale-Step-6-doc-comment finding — deliberately NOT re-logged (dedup). New numbers
  start at 59 to avoid colliding with #54's pending #58.
- Discovered (new FOLLOW_UPS entries):
  - FU-59 [P3] Legacy message-creation API orphaned by M0 — `POST /api/messages` +
    status-poll `GET /api/messages/:id` mounted but unreachable; the deleted
    `NewMessageView` (M0/#55, commit 48079d8) was their sole caller. POST still spends
    ElevenLabs with no Step 6 cost cap.
  - FU-60 [P4] Dead `POST /api/onboarding/complete` route — superseded by the
    `completeOnboarding` server action (FU-42 path); stamp-only partial duplicate, no caller.
- Triggers came true: none newly actionable on `main` (FU-34's trigger was already
  resolved on `main` by M0/#55; the prior triage #54 flagged it pre-M0).
- Reviewed-and-cleared: cost-control/rate-limit layer, `VAULT_PRICING` placeholder
  price IDs (display-struct cruft, checkout uses env IDs), and the live audio-upload
  / voice-profiles / Step 6 routes — no entry warranted.
- Branch / commit: `triage/2026-06-19` @ <this commit>
- Checks: n/a (docs-only; CI re-runs lint/typecheck/test/build on the PR).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-16 — scheduled (fix)
- Outcome: Fixed — onboarding's final "save my details" step used to navigate the
  user into the app even when the save silently failed, losing everything they
  typed; it now stops and lets them retry.
- Item: FU-42 [P2] — Onboarding completion swallows a failed save → profile silently lost.
- Root cause: symptom — a new user finishes onboarding, the profile write fails
  (RLS / transient DB / constraint), and they're sent into the app anyway with
  their name/DOB/city gone and `onboarding_completed_at` still null (treated as
  not-onboarded next visit). Cause — the `completeOnboarding` server action ran
  the `profiles` UPDATE but never inspected the returned `{ error }`, so a failed
  write resolved as success; the expired-session branch (`if (!user) return;`)
  likewise resolved silently. Why this addresses the cause — the write now goes
  through `persistOnboardingCompletion`, which throws on a returned error, and
  the expired-session branch throws too. A thrown action rejects the client
  `await`, so `router.push` is skipped and the existing `OnboardingScreen`
  `try/catch` keeps the user on the final screen with their draft intact. This
  fixes the swallow at its source (the unchecked error), not a downstream symptom.
- Branch / commit: refactor/fu-42-onboarding-save-check @ 1971c6c
- Checks: typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit ✅ (184/184; +3 new in
  tests/unit/complete-onboarding.test.ts). Non-visual change (server action +
  helper); no browser verification needed.
- Discovered: FU-57 [P4] — onboarding completion failure now resets the wizard
  silently (no visible "couldn't save, try again" message). Logged, not fixed
  (UI copy → needs in-browser verification, out of scope for this run).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-13 — discovery (scheduled triage)
- Outcome: Scan-only (read-only) — logged 5 new backlog items; no code touched.
- Scanned: health checks on `main` (typecheck ✅ · lint ✅ · test:unit 154/154 ✅);
  marker-debt grep over `src/` (all pre-existing TODOs already tracked); deep
  reads of the Stripe/subscription, voice-creation/ElevenLabs, audio-upload
  pipeline, onboarding, and auth/profile subsystems. Active feature branch
  `feat/step6-a6-screen` (the whole Step 6 message-creation flow) was treated
  as work-in-progress and excluded.
- Discovered (new FOLLOW_UPS entries):
  - FU-42 [P2] Onboarding completion swallows a failed save → profile silently lost.
  - FU-43 [P3] Voice-creation success doesn't verify its DB write → "ready" reported while stuck "processing".
  - FU-44 [P3] Checkout customer-id save unchecked → duplicate Stripe customers on retry.
  - FU-45 [P4] Signed-URL routes log usage "success" before the work that can fail.
  - FU-46 [P3] init-upload storage_path write unchecked → breaks commit; + dead extension ternary.
- Triggers came true: Screen 10 went live with real avatar upload — FU-6
  (object-fit half shipped), FU-7 and FU-9 appear implemented (flagged for the
  fixer to verify + strike; discovery does not strike).
- Reviewed-and-cleared: Stripe webhook handlers + `upsertSubscription` are
  correctly error-guarded and idempotent — no entry warranted.
- Branch / commit: `triage/2026-06-13` @ <this commit>
- Checks: n/a (docs-only; CI re-runs lint/typecheck/test/build on the PR).
- Merged: <stamped later when the owner merges>

## 2026-06-13 — system setup (on-demand, by Claude + owner)
- Outcome: System hardened — not an agent fix run. Recorded for traceability.
- Added: band-aid safeguards + root-cause discipline, the in-flight-branch
  skip rule, honest-verification + backlog-coordination rails, this run
  log, and a `test:unit` step in CI so the agent's "checks pass" claim is
  independently verified by GitHub.
- Branch / commit: `harden/refactoring-system` (this branch)
- Checks: n/a (docs + CI config only)
- Note: first scheduled fix run is Monday 2026-06-15 06:00 ET; a one-off
  test run was also triggered on 2026-06-13. Their entries will appear
  above this line.
